Hi! This is a MERN-stack project that I followed on Youtube from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8YELRmUb5o.

Frontend: React
Middleware: Express and NodeJS
Backend: MongoDB

I've picked up API calling, making reusable React components, and how to perform authentication with a login page using auth routes, and connecting with the backend database as well.
